# Surf's Up Ice Cream in Hawaii

## Overview

The purpose of this analysis was to gather climate data for the months of December and June in Hawaii, 
insert the data into a SQLite database, query the data, and finally visualize it and run statistical analysis. 
This was done to provide useful weather information for starting an ice cream business and painting a picture 
of when to expect business to ebb and flow based on the weather.

## Results

A few observations may be made from the weather data collected:

- June temperatures averaged 75°F with no major outliers with which to be concerned. Further, the temperature
swing on either side of the average is quite consistent, with both the positive and negative swing 10°F from 
the average. June temperatures are relatively stable and comfortable with no major swings.
